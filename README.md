# Hello, I'm Iosif Pintirishis 👋

I am a passionate data scientist with a strong foundation in **mathematics**, **statistics**, and **data science**. 

- 🎓 **Education**:  
  - **BSc in Mathematics and Statistics**  
  - **MSc in Data Science** from the **University of Cyprus**  

- 💼 **Current Role**:  
  Risk Consultant at **KPMG Cyprus**, where I apply advanced analytics and statistical models to help businesses manage risks and make data-driven decisions.

- 📚 **Research Interests**:  
  I'm deeply interested in the theoretical and practical aspects of **statistics** and **data science**.   
  Specifically, my current Master's research project focuses on applying **Bayesian modeling** to **sparse and power-law graphs** in **financial networks**. It involves analyzing a **real-world U.S. equities network**. Using Bayesian approaches, we identify **overlapping communities of stocks** that exhibit similar behavior, uncovering **co-movement patterns** and **diversification opportunities**. This research demonstrates the power of **Bayesian methods** in understanding market structures and could inform **portfolio construction strategies**.  
  I would like to pursue a **PhD in Statistics** to further explore my research interests and contribute to the field.
